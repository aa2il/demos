# Under uv:
#     rm -r .venv/ pyproject.toml .python-version uv.lock
#     uv init
#     uv add -r requirements.txt
#
# On RPI, also need:
#     uv pip install -r requirements.txt
#

# I "think" the fix is to add       video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080M@60D
# to the end of the line in /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt.   This seems to work
# but I'm not convinced yet ... keep trying ...      See also demos/hello3.py
